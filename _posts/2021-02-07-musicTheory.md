## Scale Degrees

<img src="/assets/images/scaleDegrees.png"/>

## Major Scale

W-W-H-W-W-W-H

<img src="/assets/images/majorScale.png"/>

## Minor Scale

The minor scale is distinguished primarily by its mediant, which lies a half step lower than the third degree of the major mode.

- **Natural minor scale**: submediant ($\hat6$) and leading tone ($\hat7$) are a half degree lower than in major. W-H-W-W-H-W-W.
- **Harmonic minor scale**: raising the leading tone ($\hat7$) by a half step in natural minor scale. W-H-W-W-H-A-H.
- **Melodic minor scale**: raising the submediant ($\hat6$) and leading tone ($\hat7$) by a half step in natural minor scale. W-H-W-W-W-W-H.

## Identifying Key Signatures

In major, the tonic is the pitch one half step above the final sharp or the penultimate flat; in minor, the tonic lies three half steps below its relative major key.

## Intervals

The distance between the pitches in a **dyad** is an **interval**.

### Generic Intervals

The numerical label that identifies the distance between letter names is called the **generic** name. Notice that the first and last note SHOULD be included in counting. For example, A up to E is a fifth.

When one pitch follows another in time, the interval is called a **melodic interval**, or linear interval. If the two pitches sound simultaneously, the interval is called a **harmonic interval**.

Intervals no larger than the octave are called **simple intervals**. Intervals larger than the octave are called **compound intervals**.

### Specific Intervals

Specific intervals are grouped into two basic categories: **Perfect** (P) and **Major** (M)/**minor** (m).

- Specific intervals above $\hat1$ in the major scale: <img src="/assets/images/specificIntervals-major.png"/>
- Specific intervals above $\hat1$ in the minor scale: <img src="/assets/images/specificIntervals-minor.png"/>

Increasing the size of a major interval or perfect interval by a half step will result in an **augmented interval** (A or +); decreasing the size of a minor interval or perfect interval by a half step will result in a **diminished interval** (d or $\circ$).

**Diatonic intervals** are intervals found in major and minor mode. It includes all major/minor intervals, perfect intervals, and augmented fourth/diminished fifth.

#### Interval Inversion

When we move the lower pitch of a simple interval up one octave so that it is placed above the higher pitch, we have **inverted** the interval. Inversion also occurs when we place the higher pitch of a simple interval below the lower pitch.

#### Consonant and Dissonant Intervals

- **Consonant intervals**: diatonic forms of the unison, the third, the fifth (perfect only), the sixth, and the octave.
    - **Perfect consonances**: the perfect unison, the perfect octave, and the perfect fifth.
    - **Imperfect consonances**: the major and minor thirds and sixths.
- **Dissonant intervals**: the second, the seventh, and all diminished and augmented intervals. Notice that the perfect fourth is usually viewed as a dissonant interval.

## Simple and Compound Meters

Meters in which the beat is divided into twos are **simple meters**, while **compound meters** are meters in which the beat is divided into threes.

# Chapter 2: Introduction to Melody and Two-Voice Counterpoint

## Guidelines for Writing Melodies

1. Begin your melody on a member of the tonic triad ($\hat1$&ndash;$\hat3$&ndash;$\hat5$), and end it with the two-pitch pattern $\hat2$&ndash;$\hat1$ or $\hat7$&ndash;$\hat1$. The aproach to the final pitch by step is called a **melodic cadence**.
2. Limit the **range** of your melody (the total span of pitches) to the interval of a tenth, and set most of your melodic activity within a comfortable interval (**tessitura**) of about a sixth.
3. Move primarily by step, which is called **conjunct motion**.
4. You can also move with occasional skips (of thirds, fourths and fifths) to add interest; this is called **disjunct motion**. However, disjunct motion should:
    - be generally confined to small intervals, such as thirds, although you can use one or two larger leaps if they are no larger than a perfect fifth.
    - traverse consonant melodic intervals (i.e., no distant leaps, such as a diminished fourth).
    - resolve tensions. Some scale members have strong melodic pulls toward another member, usually the one lying a half step away. Such tendency tones create an important tension, but you should always resolve their tension. The most important tendency tone is the leading tone, which should ascend by step to $\hat1$ unless $\hat7$ is part of a descending melodic line $\hat8$&ndash;$\hat7$&ndash;$\hat6$&ndash;$\hat5$.
    - lead to a change of direction that fills in at least some of the musical space that was created by the leap, called the “law of recovery.” This is not essential for skips of a third, but it is mandatory with larger leaps, such as a fifth.
    - rarely use multiple skips one after the other. You can use two skips in a row if they are both thirds and if you change direction after the second skip.
    - avoid repeated notes and repetitive patterns, or *sequences* (for example, $\hat1$&ndash;$\hat2$&ndash;$\hat3$, $\hat2$&ndash;$\hat3$&ndash;$\hat4$, $\hat3$&ndash;$\hat4$&ndash;$\hat5$)&mdash;at least for now. Repeated notes create undesirable rhythmic groupings and rhythmic stagnation.
5. Aim for a logical shape. A melody commonly creates an arch that slowly rises to a single high point, or **melodic climax**, and then returns to the starting point.

## Two-Voice Counterpoint

Johann Fux developed a particularly succinct pedagogy that was used by many musicians including Mozart in teaching counterpoint.

Fux begins with a study of melody. In subsequent chapters he uses these melodies, called **cantus firmi** [“fixed songs”; singular: **cantus firmus** (**CF**)], as the structural pillars against which he teaches how to add first one voice, then two, and, still later three, creating a total of four parts.

Fux presents a series of five steps&mdash;or **species**&mdash;each of which isolates the way that an added voice would move against the CF. First-species counterpoint adds one pitch against each pitch in the CF; in two-species counterpoint, two pitches are written against a single pitch in the CF. Subsequent species add more pitches to the contrapuntal voice as well as new rhythmic procedures.

### First-Species Counterpoint

<img src="/assets/images/1-1cp.png"/>


#### Contrapuntal Motions

1. Voices that move in opposite directions from one another create **contrary motion**. Contrary motion creates the most independence between voices. You should therefore incorporate it as much as possible.
2. Voices that move in the same general direction produce **similar motion**. Similar motion is most effective when using imperct consonances.
3. Voices that move in the same direction and maintain the same generic interval create **parallel motion**. You many only use imperct consonances (thirds and sixths) in parellel motions in order to maintain the independence and momentum of the two voices. Further, parallel motion in thirds or sixths should be limited to a maximum of three consecutive uses (6&ndash;6&ndash;6, or 3&ndash;3&ndash;3) in order to avoid monotony.

**Direct intervals** (also called **hidden intervals** or **similar intervals**) are created when approaching a perfect interval by similar motion.

#### Rules

1. Harmonic (vertical) intervals must be consonant. Notice that the perfect fourth is a dissonant interval in two-voice counterpoint.
2. Parellel perfect intervals (unisons, fifths, and octaves) are forbidden.
3. Approach perfect consonances using contrary motion; the single context in which similar motion is permitted occurs when the upper voice moves by step to the octave or fifth.
4. Begin and end your counterpoint on $\hat1$ (unless the counterpoint appears above the CF, when it may begin on $\hat5$).
5. In minor, use the lowered form of $\hat6$ and $\hat7$; raise $\hat7$ to create a leading tone only in the penultimate measure, and raise $\hat6$ when it precedes the leading tone.

Notice that the leaps allowed in first-species counterpoint are (thirds), fourths, fifths, ascending minor sixths and octaves.

#### Guidelines

1. Use step motion as much as possible in the contrapuntal voice, with occasional skips (jumps of a third) or leaps (jumps of a fourth or more) to add interest. Change direction and move by step after a leap.
2. Since the goal of counterpoint is voice independence, use contrary motion as much as possible. Parallel motion is restricted to imperfect consonances; limit to three consecutive uses.
3. Use imperfect consonances as verticalities when possible. Restrict the use of octaves and fifths to only one or two within the exercise.
4. Avoid two perfect consonances in a row since they create a hollow sound (e.g., a fifth to an octave, or vice versa).
5. Label every vertical interval.

### Second-Species Counterpoint

For every single note in the CF, there two in the contrapuntal voice. The contrapuntal motion of one voice moving while the other voice remains staionary is called **oblique motion**.

<img src="/assets/images/oblique.png"/>

- **Strong beats**: where both the CF and the added counterpoint move to new pitches.
- **Weak beats**: where only the counterpoint moves to a new pitch against the sustained CF.

#### Weak-Beat Consonance

If we want to move to a weak-beat consonance by step, there is only one way to do it: by moving from a fifth to a sixth or a sixth to a fifth, which is called **5&ndash;6 technique**. The consonant second pitch may continue its motion to the next pitch in the same direction, in which case we call it a **consonant passing tone** (**CPT**), or it may return to the pitch heard on the downbeat, in which case we call it a **consonant neighbor tone** (**CNT**).

**Consonant skips** (**CS**) are motions by a third. **Consonant leaps** (**CL**) are motions by intervals larger than a third. To skip or leap, the weak-beat note must be consonant with both the preceding melody note and the CF. CS and CL are also possible from weak beat to the strong beat, but the majority of leaps occur *within* rather than *between*  measures.

<img src="/assets/images/wbC.png"/>

#### Weak-Beat Dissonance

Second-species counterpoint uses a single type a dissonance: the **unaccented passing tone**. *Passing tones (PT) occur on a weak beat in 2:1 counterpoint, and they fill the space within the interval of a third, creating a smooth, stepwise motion*. In the following example, dissonant passing tones are marked; there are also consonant passing tones created using 5&ndash;6 technique.

<img src="/assets/images/wbD.png"/>

#### Rules

1. Strong beats must be consonant.
2. avoid parellel perfect intervals between：
    1. successive strong beats (downbeats).
    2. weak beat and strong beat (upbeat and downbeat).
3. Avoid direct motion to perfect intervals from weak to strong beats.
4. The only permitted dissonance is the weak-beat passing tone (i.e., the dissonance must fill the space of a melodic third by step between two downbeats).
5. The added voice must begin on $\hat1$ when it appears below the CF, but it may begin on $\hat1$, $\hat3$, or $\hat5$ when it appears above the CF. You may begin with a half rest, and the penultimate measure may contain either one or two pitches. The final measure must contain a whole note.
6. In minor, use the lowered form of $\hat6$ and $\hat7$; raise $\hat7$ to create a leading tone only in the penultimate measure, and raise $\hat6$ if it precedes the leading tone.

#### Guidelines

1. Incorporate as many dissonant passing tones as possible.
2. Use consonant leaps to balance dissonant passing tones.
3. Place leaps within, rather than between, measures.
4. Label every interval, and mark each dissonant passing tone with an asterisk.

# Chapter 3: Triads, Seventh Chords, and Texture

## Traids

Chords that comprise three distinct pitches stacked in thirds are called **triads**.

<img src="/assets/images/triad-C.png"/>

There are four **qualities** above a given root: **major**, **minor**, **augmented** and **diminished**. Major and minor triads are *consonant* triads while augmented and diminished triads are *dissonant* triads.

<img src="/assets/images/4typesOfTriads.png"/>

<img src="/assets/images/triadTypes.png"/>

- Major and minor triads span a P5.
- Augmented triads span an A5.
- Diminished triads span a d5.

The tight **spacing** (or voicing) of chordal members is called **close position**. If pitches of a triad are variously distributed in register, we say the triad is in **open position**.

### Triad Inversion

- **Root position**: the root of the triad is in the bass.
- **Firt inversion**: the third of the triad is in the bass.
- **Second inversion**: the fifth of the traid is in the bass.

<img src="/assets/images/triadInversion.png"/>

In first inversion, major and minor chords are less stable than in root position, because they include a perfect fourth and a major or minor sixth. This is not true for dimished triads: In root position they span a dissonant diminshed fifth, while in first inversion, they span a consonant sixth (the tritone is not audible for it does not involve the bass).

In second inversion, major and minor chords are regarded as dissonant because the perfect fourth is now formed with the bass. Notice that tridas in root position and first inversion are common in tonal music, while second inversion second-inversion triads occur only in restricted contexts.

### Figured bass

A figured bass has two components:
1. A bass note.
2. Numbers, or “figures”—listed under the bass—that indicate the generic intervals formed by the bass and each of the other voices. The numbers are typically listed one below another, from largest to smallest.

Root position yield the figure $^5_3$, first inversion $^6_3$, second inversion $^6_4$. To fill out a figured bass to chords is to **realize** a figured bass.

<img src="/assets/images/figuredBass.png"/>

#### Additional Figured Bass Conventions

**Abbreviations**:
- "$_3^5$" can be omitted entirely.
- "$_3^6$" can be omitted to "6".
- We do not abbeviate a second-inversion triad.

<img src="/assets/images/fb1.png"/>
<img src="/assets/images/fb2.png"/>

- If there is an accidental on a pitch above the bass, the same accidental is attached to the corresponding interval in the figured bass.
- If an accidental occurs on the pitch that is a third above the bass, the number $3$ is omitted and only the accidental is written.
- A plus sign or a slash through a number raises the pitch by one half step.
- If the bass note is chromatically altered, nothing changes in the figure, since the figure indicates only intervals above the bass

<img src="/assets/images/fbc.png"/>

**Chromaticism**:
- Accidentals appear next to the figure:
    - *flat sign*: the specified pitch has a flat accidental (this can also have the generic meaning of “lower by a half step”)
    - *sharp sign*: the specified pitch has a sharp accidental (this can also have the generic meaning of “raise by a half step”)
    - *natural sign*: the specified pitch has a natural sign on it.
- Accidentals appearing alone refer to the third above the bass.
- Chromaticism in the bass voice cannot&mdash;and need not&mdash;be shown in figured bass notation. <img src="/assets/images/caBass.png"/>
- The figures do not determine the registral placement of notes in the upper voices.
- Chromatic alterations in the figured bass apply only to the pitches that lie directly above the bass&mdash;they do not carry through the measure.
- The dash (&mdash;) indicates that a single voice moves by the intervals indicated on each end of the dash.

### Triads and Harmonic Analysis

<img src="/assets/images/triadTypesinMaj.png"/>

<img src="/assets/images/triadTypesinMin.png"/>

Triads are represented by roman numerals that indicate the scale degree on which they are built. Uppercase roman numerals are used for major triads; lowercase roman numerals are used for minor triads. Diminished triads are represented by lowercase roman numerals, with the addition of a small degree sign, “$^\circ$.”

<img src="/assets/images/romanNumerals.png"/>

#### Introduction to Harmonic Analysis

1. *Determine the key of the exercise*.
2. *Write out the letter name of the key*, immediately followed by a colon, at the beginning of the exercise, under the bass staff.
3. *Identify triad roots, using roman numerals under each harmony*.
4. *Do not renotate the roman numeral if a chord is immediately repeated*; you can simply draw a horizontal line that indicates the harmony is repeated.
5. If the triad is in root position, you need do nothing more. If the triad is inverted, supply a figured bass. Use the abbreviation “6” for the figure “$_3^6$” Example 3.15 shows sample harmonic analyses.

## Seventh Chords

Sonorities with four notes that can be stacked in thirds are called *seventh chords*.

Seventh chords are named according to the quality of the triad and the size of the seventh:
1. major-major seventh chord (MM 7th), called a **major seventh chord**. It is more strident than major-minor seventh chords, and is ocassionally used in common-practice but more used in 20th-century music.
2. major-minor seventh chord (Mm 7th), called a major-minor seventh chord (or a **dominant seventh chord**). It is the most common seventh chord in tonal music.
3. minor-minor seventh chord (mm 7th), called a **minor seventh chord**. It is very soft-sounding and less dissonan than that of the major seventh.
4. diminished-minor seventh chord (dm 7th, $^\varnothing$7), called a **half-diminished seventh chord**. It is a mix of effects. The dissinant triad is balanced with a less dissonant seventh. It occurs in both common-practice music and 20th-century music;
5. diminished-diminished seventh chord (dd 7th, $^\circ$7), sometimes called a fully diminished seventh chord but most often simply called a **diminished seventh chord**. It is the most dissonant seventh chord. It is found in late-Baroque works and throughout the Classical and Romantic eras.

<img src="/assets/images/seventhChordsTypes.png"/>

### Inverted Seventh Chords

<img src="/assets/images/inverted7th.png"/>

The root of the chord is the lower note of the seventh or the upper note of the second.

Composers may omit the fifth and double the root when writing root-position seventh chords, but they almost always use the complete harmonies for inverted seventh chords.

### Seventh Chords and Harmonic Analysis

- Mm and MM seventh chords require uppercase roman numerals.
- mm, dm, and dd seventh chords require lowercase roman numerals.
- dd seventh chords also require a degree sign ($^\circ$) to indicate a diminished triad and seventh.
- dm seventh chords require a slash through the degree sign ($^\varnothing$) to indicate that the sonority is half diminished.

<img src="/assets/images/seventhChordHA.png"/>

## Musical Texture

**Texture** refers to many elements of music, including register and timbre of instrumental combinations. But in particular, texture refers to music’s density (e.g., the number of voices and their spacing).

We can group types of muscial texture into three basic categories.
1. **Monophonic  texture**: a single-line melody with no accompaniment.
2. **Polyphonic texture**, also called **contrapuntal texture**: the combination of two or more melodies so there is no clear distinction between melody and accompaniment.
3. **Homophonic texture**: usually a clear melody accompanied by additional voices. It is a cross between monophonic and polyphonic textures.

### Analytical Method

The rate of harmonic change is called **harmonic rhythm**.

#### Distribution of Chord Tones and Implied Harmonies

Members of a chord in homophonic texture are usually distributed to different registers and instruments.

#### Fluency

Read pitches in bass and treble clef quickly, and attain a solid working knowledge of both alto and tenor clefs.

Develop the abilty to scan music quickly and identify patterns and repetitions.

#### Harmonic Reduction

Often it is helpful to simplify dense homophonic and polyphonic textures by notating the underlying harmony in close position on a piece of manuscript paper.
